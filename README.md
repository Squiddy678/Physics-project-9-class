# Physics project 9 class

This is an application that generates physics problems on various topics in the amount that the user enters when interacting with the user interface. 
A separate folder is created for each topic, which stores a text file with tasks and a text file with answers for tasks. All these folders are located in
the “Задачи по физике” folder. The user can choose the path to save that folder when interacting with the user interface.
